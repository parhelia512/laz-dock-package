# laz-dock-package
Extension for Lazarus-IDE to dock the package editors together with the project inspector

With AnchorDocking it is possible to make the IDE a single window. However if you open a package you first have to dock it because otherwise it will be a floating window. When you close the IDE the next time you open it you will have to do this again. With this IDE extension every new package editor is automatically docked in the same tab with the project inspector.
